# Securely Embed Payments in a NodeJS App

This is a JavaScript application that uses the React framework and Node.js to demonstrate an ecommerce shopping cart with an embedded payment solution using [North's Browser Post API](https://developer.north.com/products/online/browser-post). The code in this repository handles the back-end payment process for a simple payment form on a website. The code that handles front-end part of the payment process is located in a [separate repository](https://github.com/NorthDevelopers/North-React-Browser-Post-API-With-Shopping-Cart), allowing each to be deployed separately.

## Get Sandbox Credentials

To get started, create a free [North Developer Portal account](https://developer.north.com/register). This will allow you to get the sandbox credentials that are required to test the app. Log in to your account to view the official [Browser Post API Integration Guide](https://developer.north.com/products/online/browser-post/integration-guide), then [contact](https://developer.north.com/contact) North's Sales Engineering team to get sandbox credentials added to your Developer Portal account.
